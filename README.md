# Code Refactor Starter Code

A more descriptive title has been added to give users a broader understanding of page's content. Descriptive titles give developers an oppurtunity to match pages content with a favicon if added.  

Image elements require alt attributes in case browser cannot load image. Alt attributes give the image a description as an alternative to an error. 

Semantic HTML elements help give the index.html structure. This makes it easier for the developer to understand the HTML and the user's content is more organized in browser. Adding a header, sections, and a footer made my index.html less clutterd. 

Indentations contribute to web pages styling, positioning and overall structure of index.html. 

Making comments throughtout my index.html adds clarity to pages content behind the scenes.
