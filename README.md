# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description
A more descriptive title has been added to give users a broader understanding of the page's content.  

Image elements require alt attributes in case browser cannot load image. Alt attributes give the image a description as an alternative to an error. 

Semantic HTML elements help give the index.html structure. This makes it easier for the developer to understand the HTML and the user's content is more organized in browser. Adding a header, sections, and a footer made my HTML less cluttered. 

Indentations contribute to web pages styling, positioning and overall structure of HTML. 

Making comments throughout my HTML adds clarity to pages content behind the scenes. 

## User Story
